# CS300FinalSubmission

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course I was solving ways to implement different data structures and then figuring out which would be most efficient for the final project.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached this problem by looking into what made most of these data structures good. Then based on my research I picked which one I thought would be best for the task at hand.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

The roadblocks I encountered I overcame from youtube research and lot of stack overflow.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Yes this has been an amazing class. Learning about different structures was amazing. I did not realize how inefficient some of the code I used to make was. Now I feel like I have added a new element to my game.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I think this classes has evolved the way I write my program because we were building these data structures from scratch on the last project. This made me have to ensure it was readable because I would get confused at times.
